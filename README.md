This project will create a web app using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL to manage a dataset of 50 records, featuring pagination, search by name or location, and sorting by date or time. The backend will handle data retrieval from the PostgreSQL database, while the frontend will offer an intuitive interface for seamless user interaction.
